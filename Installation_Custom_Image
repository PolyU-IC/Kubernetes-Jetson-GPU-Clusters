@@@ Kubernetes Custom Image Installation and Configuration
@@@ Vincent Chan

Assume you have finished the Installation_Slave and Installation_Master, master and all workers are in "READY".

1) Consider a sutiable docker image which fir arm64.
   Example: nvidia-l4t-base for jetson series in ngc
   It is not necessary to pull the image manually. The assigned worker will pull and setup the container automatically.
   In master: $ sudo kubectl apply -f custom-gpu-cluster.yaml

2) Check the detail and status of the pod
   $ sudo kubectl get pods
   $ sudo kubectl describe pod deeplearning
   ** deeplearning is the name of your pod

3) In order to access the container called jetson-tensorflow
   $ ./access_jetson_tensorflow.sh
